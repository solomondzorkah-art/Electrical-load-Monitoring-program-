**Index Number:** [01240528D]
**Course:** EEE 227 (PT)

## Project Overview
This C++ application allows users to manage electrical appliances, 
calculate energy consumption, and estimate billing costs.

## Week 1 Progress
* Created core C++ application structure.
* Implemented appliance search and registration logic.
* Set up data logging files (`appliance.txt` and `billing_summary.txt`).
* Configured GitHub repository for version control.



# Electrical Load Monitoring System

A C++ application that calculates daily energy consumption and generates a monthly billing report.

## How to use
1. Add appliances to `appliance.txt` (Format: Name Watts Hours).
2. Note: Use underscores for multi-word names (e.g., Water_pump).
3. Run the program and select **Option 5** to generate `billing_summary.txt`.


##  How to Run the Simulator

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have a C++ compiler (like MinGW) installed.
2. **Compilation**: Open your terminal in this folder and run:
   ``g++ main.cpp -o Loadmonitor``
3. **Execution**: Run the program by typing:
   `./LoadMonitor`
4. **Data Persistence**: 
   - Appliance data is automatically saved to `appliance.txt`.
   - The billing report is generated in `billing_summary.txt`.
   - The electricity tariff is saved in `config.txt`.g++ main.cpp -o LoadMonitor
